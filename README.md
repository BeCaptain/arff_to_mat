# Arff to Mat

This repository uses Python to convert ARFF to MAT.

In the arff_to_mat.py, you only need to change three variables, namely `data_name` and `x_number`.

`data_name`: the name of dataset.

`x_number`: the number of feature of dataset. You should know the value of this variable in advance.

Finally, note that the data set is stored in the same location as the `delicious` of the example.
